Contributors:
Please create and update a journal file under your name:
  - each time you work on the project, update your journal file with the date and what you worked on
  - Upload all code used (even testing projects) to the repository with proper accreditation
  - Be prepared to Demo/briefly present what you worked on at group meetings
This will help keep everyone up to date and make group meeting minutes easier to catalogue. 

Please check the "Project Task Dependencies" flowchart on the Group drive and identify which part you are working on.
  - if the flowchart needs to be changed/updated, bring it up at the meeting or log it in your journal
  
Next scheduled meeting: Friday February 23 @ 2pm
